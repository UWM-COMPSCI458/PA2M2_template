# Programming Assignment 2 Milestone 2 (PA2M2)

This README does not describe the assignment as it makes it difficult for me to make changes if needed after the assignment is accepted. Instead, please reference the assignment page on Canvas.

## AI Usage

Describe below how you used AI when completing this project. This will help me understand how students are using AI and can help resolve plagarisim issues if they arrive. Be specific about which parts of the code were created using the assistance of AI. For example, you might write, "I used ChatGPT 4.0 to help with parsing the argument string". As described in the assignment and in the syllabus, you are still required to provide comments at the top of code that was generated using AI.
